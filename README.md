# Selection Highlighter

Present your code in style by highlighting lines of code and the non-selected code fades away in the background.

![Example Usage](/resources/example-usage.gif)

### How it works

1. Toggle Selection Highlighter in the current workspace
2. Select some code and the others fade away to an opacity of your choice
3. Deselect, or toggle Selection Highlighter to go back to normal


### Settings

- Specify how opaque the non-selected rows should be. Default is `2` from an allowed range of `0-9`. (`0` is invisible, `9` very slightly faded.)
- Show or hide the highlighter icon in the status bar when the highlighter is active. Default is to show.
