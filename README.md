# Selection Highlighter

Present your code in style by highlighting lines of code and the non-selected code fades away in the background.

### How it works

1. Toggle Selection Highlighter in the current workspace
2. Select some code and the others fade away to an opacity of your choice
3. Deselect, escape, or toggle Selection Highlighter to go back to normal
